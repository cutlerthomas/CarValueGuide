A data driven approach to finding the value of a vehicle based of mechanical components

Running cluster.py w/ the cars.csv file will build the final .csv file used to initialize dataset used by server.py

output.txt contains insights on PCA breakdown, including the weight of the most influential features for each x(P1), y(P2), and z(P3) axis. Contains Silhouette scores for cluster, and meta_clustering of data.
