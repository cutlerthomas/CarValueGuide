A data driven approach to finding the value of a vehicle based of mechanical components

Running cluster.py w/ the cars.csv file will build the final .csv file used to power the front_end built using Dash/Plotly.

output.txt contains insights on PCA breakdown, including the weight of the most influential features for each x(P1), y(P2), and z(P3) axis. Contains Silhouette scores for cluster, and meta_clustering of data.
